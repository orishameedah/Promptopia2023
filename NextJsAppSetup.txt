Firstly we created a new folder in our local disk directory called promptapp2023-nextjs and then we open it on our
vscode to start coding in it.
But before anything we need to setup our next js application by doing this 
C:\promptapp2023-nextjs>npx create-next-app@latest ./
- But you will be ask some few things like 
- Would you like to use TypeScript? No
- Would you like to use ESLint ? No
- Would you like to use Tailwind CSS ? Yes
- Would you like to use `src/` directory ? No
- Would you like to use App Router ? (recommended) Yes
- Would you like to customize the default import alias? Yes
_ Then after you have succesfully answered to all this prompt it will start installing the neccessary dependencies for the application
But after that we need to install some other dependencies as well like this
C:\promptapp2023-nextjs>npm install bcrypt mongodb mongoose next-auth
So after all this is done will have succesfully setup our nextjs environment.
- There are some other things we have to do in the folder like deleting some folder because we will create a new one(app, public)
- Then we create new folder app, components, models(for our mongodb schema), public, styles (for styling our application)
utils and create a new file called .env
